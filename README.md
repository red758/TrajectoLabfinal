# 🚀 TrajectoLab

TrajectoLab is an interactive physics simulation engine that visualizes projectile motion in real time.  
It allows users to experiment with different physical parameters and observe how they affect motion trajectories and energy behavior.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Understanding projectile motion through equations alone can be abstract and unintuitive.  
TrajectoLab bridges this gap by providing a real-time, visual, and interactive simulation that makes physics concepts easier to grasp.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Brief)
The simulation uses custom kinematic equations to calculate projectile motion frame-by-frame.  
Gravity, drag, and velocity vectors are recalculated in real time and rendered on an HTML5 Canvas to ensure smooth and accurate visualization.
